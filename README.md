# OSS Development Cost Breakdown

Breakdown of my monthly Open Source development costs. 

I created this to outline what on average it costs me to develop OSS. While it would be nice to break even with sponsors, I do OSS for fun & not for money. This is more informational for anyone who choose to follow in my foot steps. 

## What I Pay For

|Name|Cost|Interval|Justification|
|----|----|--------|-------------|
|GitHub Pro| 4 USD | Monthly | Additional features and higher limits help a lot when developing the number of repos I do.|
|DockerHub Pro|5 USD | Monthly | Pro features are super useful for aid in some of my bigger repos like vulnerability scanning and image inspections.|
|Dedicated Servers|50 USD| Monthly | A dedicated server setup to serve as my playground for development projects and host production grade projects when they are completed. IE [My valheim project has 3 servers running on these systems.](https://github.com/mborund18/valheim-docker)|
| IDE | 249 USD | Yearly | While there are free editors and I do use them from time to time, its hard to beat the integrations currently available on IntelliJ |
| Dbeaver | 23 USD | Monthly | There is no better IDE for databases on the market in my opinion | 


*Yearly Cost*: 1,233 USD

- Food and other things to sustain myself.
